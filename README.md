2. Test find the text string on full Screen.
3. When test is successful, you may copy the code
   and paste it into your own script.
   Note: Copy the "FindText()" function and the following
   functions and paste it into your own script Just once.
4. The more recommended way is to save the script as
   "FindText.ahk" and copy it to the "Lib" subdirectory
   of AHK program, instead of copying the "FindText()"
   function and the following functions, add a line to
   the beginning of your script: #Include <FindText>
5. If you want to call a method in the "FindTextClass" class,
   use the parameterless FindText() to get the default object
